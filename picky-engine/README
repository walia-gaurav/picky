Create following directory:

/var/webapp/upload/

sudo mdkir -p /var/webapp/upload/
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/webapp/upload/

In the TOMCAT home folder go to conf folder and edit server.xml:

Add <Context docBase="/var/webapp/upload" path="/uploads" /> inside <Host> </Host> tags.

When running TOMCAT make sure that same folder is the CATALINA_BASE variable.

In Intellij you will need to edit the run/debug settings and add this enviroment variable in the startup.
